    <p>This model aims to help an investor decide what stocks to invest in or what stocks to sell by attempting to predict the outcome of a publicly-traded company's quarterly earnings report. One of the key metrics released during each quarter is the Earnings Per Share (EPS), which is a reflection of the companies performance. If the EPS exceeds expectations, investors usually invest more in the company, subsequently raising the share price. Conversely, if the EPS falls below expectations, investors are prone to selling the stock, which causes a fall in share price. This model uses a freely-avaibable Facebook dataset which tracks the checkins, likes, and talking about counts for many companies over time. The checkins are used as a feature to quantify the trends in consumer activity at a physical company storefront, and are therefore a reflection of company performance. To summarize, by using data leading up to the release of a quarterly earnings report, this model will recommend to buy or sell a stock depending on predicted performance, which can both maximize profit and minimize loss while investing.</p>
    
    </p>Data are found from multiple sources. The Facebook dataset, which is around 0.5 GB in size, is provided freely by Thinknum. Furthermore, two financial datasets are found using webscraping and availible APIs. Reported and expected EPS data, and release dates are found by web-scraping Yahoo Finance using the python Requests library and Beautiful Soup. Stock price, as well as quarterly revenue, profit, loss, and quarter dates are retrieved using a financial API provided by Intrinio. The Facebook dataset contains both public and private companies, and does not include stock information. The Intrinio API is again used to search for similar sounding companies, which are then processed using the Fuzzy Wuzzy library to find the best company match and stock ticker.</p>

    </p>A machine learning model was implemented in order to predict the surprise EPS. The input dataframe was constructed as follows. Each row serves as one observation of a company's quarterly results. Six features are used, including the average checkins, average likes, and average talking about counts for that quarter, as well as the reported EPS. The remaining two features are found from feature engineering, using the ratio of both total gross profit and total operating expenses to the total revenue for that quarter. Because the likes, checkins, and talking about counts vary over several orders of magnitude across different companies, a StandardScaler transformer was constructed to scale the input data to more reasonable magnitudes. This transformer is placed in a pipeline along with a random forest predictor, and a gridsearch is performed to find optimal parameters. The accuracy is found to be ~0.95 for the training set and ~0.40 for the test set. It should be noted that the low performance seen in the test set is likely due to the quality of the data which includes companies with no physical presence or publicly-traded stock.</p>
